{"Id":465,"Description":"<p>The AllergyIntolerance resource defines clinical information about a patient's allergic response to a substance. It defines the substance that elicited the response, as well as when the reaction occurred, the severity, and the type of reaction noted. The AllergyIntolerance resource can also accommodate search by ID and by patient, allowing it to return a list of allergies. If a patient has no active allergies, an AllergyIntolerance resource will be returned indicating whether the patient's allergies have never been reviewed (are not on file), or if they have been reviewed and it has been determined that they have no known allergies.</p>\n\n<p>This resource can also return unconfirmed AllergyIntolerance resources in the \"holding tank\" that drives the EpicCare Reconcile Outside Data Activity.
