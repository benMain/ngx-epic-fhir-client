{"Id":1074,"Description":"<p>This web service retrieves a genomic indicator from a patient's chart. Genomic indicators represent the implications of genetic lab results for a given patient. For example, a genomic indicator, created based on the presence of several variants in the patient's genetic test results, might indicate a sensitivity to the drug warfarin. The system might then show BestPractice Advisories to clinicians prescribing warfarin, triggered by the genomic indicator in the patient's chart, so that they are aware of additional considerations for specific medication. This resource can be queried by a patient ID.</p>","Namespace":"N/A","WsdlFile":"N/A","HttpMethod":"","UrlTemplate":"api/FHIR/R4/Condition/{ID}","SampleRequest":"<p>https://hostname/instance/api/FHIR/R4/Condition/&lt;conditionID&gt;</p>","SampleResponse":"<p>&lt;Condition xmlns=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\"&gt;</p><p>&lt;id value=\"e7ijxUCtjzFLHvDFSIqXu2w3\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;category&gt;</p><p>&lt;coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"http://open.epic.com/FHIR/R4/StructureDefinition/condition-category\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code value=\"genomics\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"Genomic Indicators\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;text value=\"Genomic Indicators\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.96\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code value=\"7114833003\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"warfarin insensitive indicator\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;text value=\"Warfarin Insensitive\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;subject&gt;</p><p>&lt;reference value=\"Patient/ej4nFxzySJAysjMuv4rTBNA3\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"Oluo, Madison\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/subject&gt;</p><p>&lt;recordedDate value=\"2020-02-04T20:34:49Z\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/Condition&gt;</p>","Remarks":null,"Errors":[],"ChangeLog":null,"ImportSections":{},"Parameters":{"RequestRootType":{"Id":231030,"Name":"Request","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"ID":{"Id":231031,"Name":"ID","AltName":null,"Type":"String","Description":"FHIR identifier for the target Condition resource.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":1,"TypeId":5487}},"Order":0,"TypeId":5486},"ResponseRootType":{"Id":231032,"Name":"Response","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"Condition":{"Id":231033,"Name":"Condition","AltName":null,"Type":"Condition","Description":"An instance of the R4 Condition resource.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{"category":{"Id":231128,"Name":"category","AltName":null,"Type":"CodeableConcept","Description":"Always \"genomics\" for patient genomic indicators.","Optional":"False","IsArray":true,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":366},"evidence":{"Id":231423,"Name":"evidence","AltName":null,"Type":"Evidence","Description":null,"Optional":"True","IsArray":true,"Children":{"detail":{"Id":231439,"Name":"detail","AltName":null,"Type":"Reference","Description":"Reference to a lab observation.","Optional":"True","IsArray":true,"Children":{},"Order":10003,"TypeId":373}},"Order":10002,"TypeId":5484},"id":{"Id":231034,"Name":"id","AltName":null,"Type":"String","Description":"The indicator FHIR ID.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":5474},"recordedDate":{"Id":231041,"Name":"recordedDate","AltName":null,"Type":"String","Description":"The date the indicator was recorded.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":5481},"subject":{"Id":231176,"Name":"subject","AltName":null,"Type":"Reference","Description":"The patient associated with the indicator.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":373}},"Order":10001,"TypeId":5473}},"Order":10000,"TypeId":5488}},"Banners":[],"Success":true,"Message":null}
