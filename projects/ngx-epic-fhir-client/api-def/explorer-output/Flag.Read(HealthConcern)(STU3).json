{"Id":10205,"Description":"This web service retrieves high-level problem list data and health status data from a patient's chart for problems with a class of “Health Concern,” which indicates that the problem is of special concern. Like the Condition (Health Concern) web service, this web service evaluates problem list (LPL) records, but it returns only a brief overview of key information about those records, such as whether they are active and when they were resolved. If you need to return more detailed information, use the Condition (Health Concern) web service instead.","Namespace":"","WsdlFile":"","HttpMethod":"GET","UrlTemplate":"/api/FHIR/STU3/Flag/{ID}","SampleRequest":"/api/FHIR/STU3/Flag/eyy2ff4sfMS2r1RFpnKxJaP.VLBEBhq5JiMivDW.0klM3","SampleResponse":"{\n    \"resourceType\": \"Flag\",\n    \"id\": \"eyy2ff4sfMS2r1RFpnKxJaP.VLBEBhq5JiMivDW.0klM3\",\n    \"extension\": [\n        {\n            \"valueReference\": {\n                \"reference\": \"https://eccp-internal.epic.com/Interconnect-CDE/api/FHIR/STU3/Condition/e9GSKtqsGaRoWStLyW.4M25VxQEoL-g8xflhHLPMHQT43\",\n                \"display\": \"Eczema\"\n            },\n            \"url\": \"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/flag-detail\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"category\": {\n        \"coding\": [\n            {\n                \"system\": \"http://open.epic.com/FHIR/StructureDefinition/flag-category\",\n                \"code\": \"health-concern\",\n                \"display\": \"Health Concern Flag\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"system\": \"http://loinc.org\",\n                \"code\": \"75323-6\",\n                \"display\": \"condition\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"text\": \"Health Concern Flag\"\n    },\n    \"code\": {\n        \"coding\": [\n            {\n                \"system\": \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.90\",\n                \"code\": \"L30.9\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"system\": \"http://snomed.info/sct\",\n                \"code\": \"43116000\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"text\": \"Eczema\"\n    },\n    \"subject\": {\n        \"reference\": \"https://eccp-internal.epic.com/Interconnect-CDE/api/FHIR/STU3/Patient/exnWmPch0AyoUp7ZBplVf.Q3\",\n        \"display\": \"DXL, Contacts\"\n    },\n    \"period\": {\n        \"start\": \"2021-07-27\"\n    },\n    \"_status\": {\n        \"extension\": [\n            {\n                \"valueCode\": \"unknown\",\n                \"url\": \"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}","Remarks":null,"Errors":[],"ChangeLog":null,"ImportSections":{},"Parameters":{"RequestRootType":{"Id":439446,"Name":"Request","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"ID":{"Id":439447,"Name":"ID","AltName":null,"Type":"String","Description":"The Flag FHIR ID.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":1,"TypeId":8883}},"Order":0,"TypeId":8882},"ResponseRootType":{"Id":439448,"Name":"Response","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"Flag":{"Id":439449,"Name":"Flag","AltName":null,"Type":"Flag","Description":"A single instance of a Flag resource.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{"category":{"Id":439514,"Name":"category","AltName":null,"Type":"CodeableConcept","Description":"The Epic category ID for the condition, labeled “health-concern,” and the LOINC code for the condition, labeled “condition.”","Optional":"True","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":31},"code":{"Id":439526,"Name":"code","AltName":null,"Type":"CodeableConcept","Description":"The diagnosis code for the condition.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":31},"flag-detail":{"Id":439482,"Name":"extension","AltName":"flag-detail","Type":"Extension","Description":"A reference to the Condition (Health Concern) resource.","Optional":"True","IsArray":true,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":14},"id":{"Id":439450,"Name":"id","AltName":null,"Type":"String","Description":"The Flag FHIR ID.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":8886},"meta":{"Id":439454,"Name":"meta","AltName":null,"Type":"Meta","Description":"The document metadata.","Optional":"True","IsArray":false,"Children":{"profile":{"Id":439458,"Name":"profile","AltName":null,"Type":"String","Description":"Available in Netherlands environments only.
