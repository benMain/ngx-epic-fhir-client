{"Id":984,"Description":"<p>This web service retrieves problem list and health status data from a patient's chart. This includes any data found in the patient chart across all encounters. Note that very few Epic organizations record a health status for patients, so in most cases this resource will be used to retrieve problem list items only. This resource can be queried by a combination of patient ID and status.</p><p>This resource returns a smaller subset of elements for health status conditions as compared to problem list items. For health status, severity, onsetPeriod, abatementPeriod, and note elements are not populated.</p><p>Some problems on the problem list may be marked with a class of \"Health Concern\", indicating that the problem is of special concern. Problems flagged with this special class will be returned alongside the other problems, however they will be annotated with a special category of health-concern. </p><p>Note that this resource retrieves only data stored in problem list (LPL) records. As a result, medical history data documented outside of a patient's problem list isn't available to applications using this service unless that data is retrieved using another method.</p><p>A user or staff member accessing this FHIR resource must have appropriate security to view problem list items and/or health status.</p><p>MyChart users must have security to see problem list information.</p><p>Patient-level break-the-glass functionality is in place for this resource.</p>","Namespace":"N/A","WsdlFile":"N/A","HttpMethod":"GET","UrlTemplate":"api/FHIR/R4/Condition/{ID}","SampleRequest":"<p>https://hostname/instance/api/FHIR/R4/Condition/e4rZHYhpQVxn1J663BX9ILw3</p>","SampleResponse":"<p>&lt;Condition xmlns=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\"&gt;</p><p>&lt;id value=\"e4rZHYhpQVxn1J663BX9ILw3\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;clinicalStatus&gt;</p><p>&lt;coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/condition-clinical\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;version value=\"4.0.0\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code value=\"active\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"Active\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;text value=\"Active\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/clinicalStatus&gt;</p><p>&lt;verificationStatus&gt;</p><p>&lt;coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/condition-ver-status\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;version value=\"4.0.0\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code value=\"confirmed\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"Confirmed\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;text value=\"Confirmed\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/verificationStatus&gt;</p><p>&lt;category&gt;</p><p>&lt;coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"http://loinc.org\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code value=\"75310-3\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"Health concerns\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/extension-codes\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code value=\"health-concern\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"Health Concern\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;text value=\"Health Concern\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/category&gt;</p><p>&lt;code&gt;</p><p>&lt;coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"http://snomed.info/sct\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code value=\"438949009\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"Alive\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;text value=\"alive\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/code&gt;</p><p>&lt;subject&gt;</p><p>&lt;reference value=\"Patient/ej4nFxzySJAysjMuv4rTBNA3\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"Lufhir, Meiko H Jr., MD\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/subject&gt;</p><p>&lt;recordedDate value=\"2019-08-26\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/Condition&gt;</p>","Remarks":null,"Errors":[],"ChangeLog":null,"ImportSections":{},"Parameters":{"RequestRootType":{"Id":166137,"Name":"Request","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"ID":{"Id":166138,"Name":"ID","AltName":null,"Type":"String","Description":"FHIR identifier for the target Condition resource.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":1,"TypeId":5487}},"Order":0,"TypeId":5486},"ResponseRootType":{"Id":166139,"Name":"Response","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"Condition":{"Id":166140,"Name":"Condition","AltName":null,"Type":"Condition","Description":"An instance of the R4 Condition resource.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{"abatementPeriod":{"Id":166385,"Name":"abatementPeriod","AltName":null,"Type":"Period","Description":"The date the condition was resolved.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":369},"category":{"Id":166235,"Name":"category","AltName":null,"Type":"CodeableConcept","Description":"One or both of \"health-concern\" and \"problem-list-item\".","Optional":"False","IsArray":true,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":366},"clinicalStatus":{"Id":166211,"Name":"clinicalStatus","AltName":null,"Type":"CodeableConcept","Description":"The clinical status, which can be active, resolved, or inactive.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":366},"code":{"Id":166259,"Name":"code","AltName":null,"Type":"CodeableConcept","Description":"External codings for the condition.
