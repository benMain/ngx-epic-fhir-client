{"Id":10206,"Description":"This web service retrieves high-level problem list data and health status data from a patient's chart for problems with a class of “Health Concern,” which indicates that the problem is of special concern. Like the Condition (Health Concern) web service, this web service evaluates problem list (LPL) records, but it returns only a brief overview of key information about those records, such as whether they are active and when they were resolved. If you need to return more detailed information, use the Condition (Health Concern) web service instead.","Namespace":"","WsdlFile":"","HttpMethod":"GET","UrlTemplate":"/api/FHIR/STU3/Flag?category={category}&patient={patient}&status={status}&subject={subject}&_id={_id}","SampleRequest":"/api/FHIR/STU3/Flag?patient=exnWmPch0AyoUp7ZBplVf.Q3&amp;category=health-concern","SampleResponse":"{\n    \"resourceType\": \"Bundle\",\n    \"type\": \"searchset\",\n    \"total\": 1,\n    \"link\": [\n        {\n            \"relation\": \"self\",\n            \"url\": \"https://eccp-internal.epic.com/Interconnect-CDE/api/FHIR/STU3/Flag?patient=exnWmPch0AyoUp7ZBplVf.Q3&amp;category=health-concern\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"entry\": [\n        {\n            \"link\": [\n                {\n                    \"relation\": \"self\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://eccp-internal.epic.com/Interconnect-CDE/api/FHIR/STU3/Flag/e.bNMEKc22vOeDJsMiXvWcFA5rNbXAqvcBthpAQuv88A3\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"fullUrl\": \"https://eccp-internal.epic.com/Interconnect-CDE/api/FHIR/STU3/Flag/e.bNMEKc22vOeDJsMiXvWcFA5rNbXAqvcBthpAQuv88A3\",\n            \"resource\": {\n                \"resourceType\": \"Flag\",\n                \"id\": \"e.bNMEKc22vOeDJsMiXvWcFA5rNbXAqvcBthpAQuv88A3\",\n                \"extension\": [\n                    {\n                        \"valueReference\": {\n                            \"reference\": \"https://eccp-internal.epic.com/Interconnect-CDE/api/FHIR/STU3/Condition/eR2WpIMB32cdu6NaP2lgikw3\"\n                        },\n                        \"url\": \"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/flag-detail\"\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"status\": \"active\",\n                \"category\": {\n                    \"coding\": [\n                        {\n                            \"system\": \"http://open.epic.com/FHIR/StructureDefinition/flag-category\",\n                            \"code\": \"health-concern\",\n                            \"display\": \"Health Concern Flag\"\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"system\": \"http://loinc.org\",\n                            \"code\": \"75323-6\",\n                            \"display\": \"condition\"\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    \"text\": \"Health Concern Flag\"\n                },\n                \"code\": {\n                    \"coding\": [\n                        {\n                            \"system\": \"http://snomed.info/sct\",\n                            \"code\": \"81323004\",\n                            \"display\": \"Normal General Body Function\"\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    \"text\": \"Alive and well\"\n                },\n                \"subject\": {\n                    \"reference\": \"https://eccp-internal.epic.com/Interconnect-CDE/api/FHIR/STU3/Patient/exnWmPch0AyoUp7ZBplVf.Q3\",\n                    \"display\": \"DXL, Contacts\"\n                },\n                \"period\": {\n                    \"start\": \"2021-07-27T21:00:00Z\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"search\": {\n                \"mode\": \"match\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}","Remarks":null,"Errors":[],"ChangeLog":null,"ImportSections":{},"Parameters":{"RequestRootType":{"Id":439875,"Name":"Request","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"category":{"Id":439876,"Name":"category","AltName":null,"Type":"String","Description":"Always \"health-concern\" for this web service.","Optional":"True","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":1,"TypeId":10062},"patient":{"Id":439877,"Name":"patient","AltName":null,"Type":"String","Description":"Reference to a Patient resource the Flag is for.","Optional":"Either patient or subject must be provided.
