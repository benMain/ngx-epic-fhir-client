{"Id":10016,"Description":"<p>Enables the lookup of a patient's dental treatments or options. Dental treatments represent a plan of care for one or more of a patient's issues and consist of one or more visits, which each contain one or more procedures. Dental options are options for how a treatment plan can be carried out, and each option can have its own visits and procedures, though only a single option is selected for a planned treatment. This resource can return a specific treatment or option by ID or a list of the patient's treatments (which point to their options) if you search by patient.</p>","Namespace":"","WsdlFile":"","HttpMethod":"GET","UrlTemplate":"/api/FHIR/R4/CarePlan/{ID}","SampleRequest":"https://hostname/instance/api/FHIR/R4/CarePlan/ezv8muakDf.OWIZFA0VeHykcwagO7gUw-Qo7tjhIjW7qyR.Sb9PDuVIqsXy8702ujMTksxNKECrRrtU361qN4fg3","SampleResponse":"&lt;CarePlan
