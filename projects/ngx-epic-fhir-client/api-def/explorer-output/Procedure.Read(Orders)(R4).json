{"Id":975,"Description":"<p>The FHIR Procedure resource defines an activity performed on or with a patient as part of the provision of care. It corresponds with surgeries and procedures performed, including endoscopies and biopsies, as well as less invasive actions like counseling and physiotherapy. Because terminology codes for procedures are often billing related, some procedures might not have a terminology code, especially when billing activities are not performed within Epic.</p>\n<p>This resource is designed for a high-level summarization around the occurrence of a procedure, and not for specific procedure log documentation - a concept that does not yet have a defined FHIR Resource. When searching, only completed procedures are returned.</p><p>The read interaction enables the lookup of a Procedure resource by a constant server ID. The read interaction allows clients to store only the server ID, and with a single request, retrieve the most up-to-date information about a procedure. Read interactions typically begin with a client having previously established a relationship, typically when following a reference to this resource from another resource or through querying for procedures through the search interaction.</p><p>A user or staff member accessing this FHIR resource must have security to view orders, results, and procedure reports.</p><p>A MyChart user accessing this FHIR resource must be authorized to view procedures in MyChart.</p>","Namespace":"N/A","WsdlFile":"","HttpMethod":"GET","UrlTemplate":"api/FHIR/R4/Procedure/{ID}","SampleRequest":"<p>https://hostname/instance/api/FHIR/R4/Procedure/edKALtDcuTHWnRKIEr3Jo0pNpyvR27ZfzRHNVtzFTSVk3</p>","SampleResponse":"<p>{</p><p>\"resourceType\": \"Procedure\",</p><p>\"id\": \"edKALtDcuTHWnRKIEr3Jo0pNpyvR27ZfzRHNVtzFTSVk3\",</p><p>\"identifier\": [</p><p>{</p><p>\"use\": \"usual\",</p><p>\"type\": {</p><p>\"text\": \"ORD\"</p><p>},</p><p>\"system\": \"urn:oid:1.2.840.114350.1.13.861.1.7.2.798268\",</p><p>\"value\": \"3326502\"</p><p>},</p><p>{</p><p>\"use\": \"usual\",</p><p>\"type\": {</p><p>\"text\": \"EAP\"</p><p>},</p><p>\"system\": \"urn:oid:1.2.840.114350.1.13.861.1.7.2.696580\",</p><p>\"value\": \"2096\"</p><p>}</p><p>],</p><p>\"status\": \"completed\",</p><p>\"code\": {</p><p>\"coding\": [</p><p>{</p><p>\"system\": \"http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt\",</p><p>\"code\": \"29405\",</p><p>\"display\": \"APPLY SHORT LEG CAST\"</p><p>}</p><p>],</p><p>\"text\": \"APPLY SHORT LEG CAST\"</p><p>},</p><p>\"subject\": {</p><p>\"reference\": \"Patient/ej4nFxzySJAysjMuv4rTBNA3\",</p><p>\"display\": \"Meiko H Lufhir Jr., MD\"</p><p>},</p><p>\"encounter\": {</p><p>\"reference\": \"Encounter/ej5R7X.4RdaFNR5vWdsTpVTtccmkRkWJcKixc5XVY4cQ3\"</p><p>},</p><p>\"performedDateTime\": \"2019-03-04T22:31:27Z\"</p><p>}</p>","Remarks":null,"Errors":[],"ChangeLog":null,"ImportSections":{},"Parameters":{"RequestRootType":{"Id":158821,"Name":"Request","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"ID":{"Id":158822,"Name":"ID","AltName":null,"Type":"String","Description":"The Procedure FHIR ID.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":1,"TypeId":5645}},"Order":0,"TypeId":5644},"ResponseRootType":{"Id":158823,"Name":"Response","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"Procedure":{"Id":158824,"Name":"Procedure","AltName":null,"Type":"Procedure","Description":null,"Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{"asserter":{"Id":159118,"Name":"asserter","AltName":null,"Type":"Reference","Description":"Reference to the Practitioner resource who asserts this procedure.","Optional":"True","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":373},"basedOn":{"Id":158895,"Name":"basedOn","AltName":null,"Type":"Reference","Description":"Order IDs for cases.","Optional":"True","IsArray":true,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":373},"bodySite":{"Id":159301,"Name":"bodySite","AltName":null,"Type":"CodeableConcept","Description":"Procedure operative region for all panels.","Optional":"True","IsArray":true,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":366},"category":{"Id":158969,"Name":"category","AltName":null,"Type":"CodeableConcept","Description":"A code that classifies the procedure.
