{"Id":977,"Description":"<p>The FHIR RelatedPerson resource is typically an entity with a personal or professional relationship to the patient. RelatedPersons are often a source of information about the patient. For integrations with Epic, the RelatedPerson is represented by a MyChart account record ID and their link to a Patient record ID. Typically the RelatedPerson represents a MyChart proxy for the patient.</p><p>The read interaction enables the lookup of a RelatedPerson resource by a constant server ID. The read interaction allows clients to store only the server ID, and with a single request, retrieve the most up-to-date information about the resource. Read interactions typically begin with a client having previously established a relationship. In this case, clients will get the FHIR ID from an OpenID Connect (OIDC) workflow.</p>","Namespace":"N/A","WsdlFile":"N/A","HttpMethod":"GET","UrlTemplate":"api/FHIR/R4/RelatedPerson/{ID}","SampleRequest":"<p>https://hostname/instance/api/FHIR/R4/RelatedPerson/e40ZMje.0zWx-ujxfsSunua79c5JesiTb.vP7Wq41U8o3</p>","SampleResponse":"<p>&lt;RelatedPerson xmlns=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\"&gt;</p><p>&lt;id value=\"ejgBZc1.cNIZzIybp6SykEPUqTAcdtAjulNzJeko6e7M3\"/&gt;</p><p>&lt;patient&gt;</p><p>&lt;reference value=\"Patient/e7XZi7JJ6AZSxlmZBc9-Rdw3\"/&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"CDS, Fhir Patient\"/&gt;</p><p>&lt;/patient&gt;</p><p>&lt;name&gt;</p><p>&lt;use value=\"usual\"/&gt;</p><p>&lt;text value=\"CDS,FHIR PROXY\"/&gt;</p><p>&lt;/name&gt;</p><p>&lt;/RelatedPerson&gt;</p>","Remarks":null,"Errors":[],"ChangeLog":null,"ImportSections":{},"Parameters":{"RequestRootType":null,"ResponseRootType":{"Id":162691,"Name":"Response","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"RelatedPerson":{"Id":162692,"Name":"RelatedPerson","AltName":null,"Type":"RelatedPerson","Description":null,"Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{"name":{"Id":162804,"Name":"name","AltName":null,"Type":"HumanName","Description":"<p>The name of the RelatedPerson.</p>","Optional":"True","IsArray":true,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":5223},"patient":{"Id":162761,"Name":"patient","AltName":null,"Type":"Reference","Description":"<p>A patient record ID, representing the patient whom the RelatedPerson has MyChart proxy access to.</p>","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":10002,"TypeId":373}},"Order":10001,"TypeId":5669}},"Order":10000,"TypeId":5668}},"Banners":[],"Success":true,"Message":null}
