Coverage resources correspond to coverage records in Epic.</p><p>In Epic, coverage records exhibit the following characteristics:</p><ul><li>The patient-level coverage list represents all possible insurances that could be billed for services. A patient might have a long list of possible coverages that are applicable only for specific services. Examples include third party liability, worker's comp, black lung insurance, Medicaid for ESRD, Medicare, commercial, etc.</li><li>For any specific visit, an account record will indicate which coverages will be used for that visit.</li><li>A single visit-level account may have multiple coverages attached. Coverage filing order indicates which is billed first.</li><li>Coverages are specific to service area. For this reason, if you are searching across multiple service areas, a patient might have what appears to be duplicate coverages.</li></ul><p>This resource typically should not be used to determine which coverages are relevant for recent or upcoming visits and services. Instead, it returns all coverages that are potentially applicable to a patient. </p><p>This resource respects patient-level break-the-glass checks as configured in Epic.
