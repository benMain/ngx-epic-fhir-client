{"Id":939,"Description":"<p>The FHIR Procedure resource defines an activity performed on or with a patient as part of the provision of care. It corresponds with surgeries and procedures performed, including endoscopies and biopsies, as well as less invasive actions like counseling and physiotherapy.</p><ul><li>Note: The STU3 version of this web service currently supports only order procedure records. Dental and surgica procedures are not yet supported. You can use the Procedure.Read (DSTU2) web service if you need to support dental or surgical procedures.</li></ul><p>This resource is designed for a high-level summarization around the occurrence of a procedure, and not for specific procedure log documentation - a concept that does not yet have a defined FHIR Resource. When searching, only completed procedures are returned.</p><p>The read interaction enables the lookup of a Procedure resource by a constant server ID. The read interaction allows clients to store only the server ID, and with a single request, retrieve the most up-to-date information about a procedure. Read interactions typically begin with a client having previously established a relationship, often through querying for Procedures through the search interaction.</p><p>A user or staff member accessing this FHIR resource must have security to view orders, results, and procedure reports.</p><p>A MyChart user accessing this FHIR resource must be authorized to view procedures in MyChart.</p>","Namespace":"N/A","WsdlFile":"N/A","HttpMethod":"GET","UrlTemplate":"api/FHIR/STU3/Procedure/{ID}","SampleRequest":"<p>https://hostname/instance/api/FHIR/STU3/Procedure/eMm0.ONP9yY6gU1plJr8Cloh9xVrrivStBjA6GTod-Ag3</p>","SampleResponse":"<p>&lt;Procedure xmlns=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\"&gt;</p><p>&lt;id value=\"eMm0.ONP9yY6gU1plJr8Cloh9xVrrivStBjA6GTod-Ag3\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;identifier&gt;</p><p>&lt;use value=\"usual\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;type&gt;</p><p>&lt;text value=\"ORD\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/type&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"urn:oid:1.2.840.114350.1.13.861.1.7.2.798268\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;value value=\"3287774\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/identifier&gt;</p><p>&lt;identifier&gt;</p><p>&lt;use value=\"usual\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;type&gt;</p><p>&lt;text value=\"EAP\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/type&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"urn:oid:1.2.840.114350.1.13.861.1.7.2.696580\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;value value=\"307\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/identifier&gt;</p><p>&lt;status value=\"completed\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;notDone value=\"false\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code&gt;</p><p>&lt;coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code value=\"11100\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"BIOPSY OF SKIN LESION\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"http://snomed.info/sct\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code value=\"129902007\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"BIOPSY OF SKIN LESION\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"http://loinc.org\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code value=\"10002-4\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"BIOPSY OF SKIN LESION\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;text value=\"BIOPSY OF SKIN LESION\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/code&gt;</p><p>&lt;subject&gt;</p><p>&lt;reference value=\"Patient/ej4nFxzySJAysjMuv4rTBNA3\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"Dan Daniels Jr., MD\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/subject&gt;</p><p>&lt;context&gt;</p><p>&lt;reference value=\"Encounter/ej5R7X.4RdaFNR5vWdsTpVTtccmkRkWJcKixc5XVY4cQ3\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/context&gt;</p><p>&lt;performedDateTime value=\"2019-02-15\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;reasonCode&gt;</p><p>&lt;coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;system value=\"http://snomed.info/sct\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;code value=\"400097005\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;display value=\"Ingrowing nail\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/coding&gt;</p><p>&lt;text value=\"Ingrowing nail\" /&gt;</p><p>&lt;/reasonCode&gt;</p><p>&lt;/Procedure&gt;</p>","Remarks":null,"Errors":[],"ChangeLog":null,"ImportSections":{},"Parameters":{"RequestRootType":{"Id":108738,"Name":"Request","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"ID":{"Id":108739,"Name":"ID","AltName":null,"Type":"String","Description":"The Procedure FHIR ID.","Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{},"Order":1,"TypeId":5366}},"Order":0,"TypeId":5365},"ResponseRootType":{"Id":108740,"Name":"Response","AltName":null,"Type":null,"Description":null,"Optional":null,"IsArray":false,"Children":{"Procedure":{"Id":108741,"Name":"Procedure","AltName":null,"Type":"Procedure","Description":null,"Optional":"False","IsArray":false,"Children":{"basedOn":{"Id":108838,"Name":"basedOn","AltName":null,"Type":"Reference","Description":"Reference to the ProcedureRequest resource that the procedure log was created from.
