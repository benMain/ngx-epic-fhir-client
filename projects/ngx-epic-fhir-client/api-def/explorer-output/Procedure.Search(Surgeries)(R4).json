{"Id":10042,"Description":"<p>The FHIR Procedure resource defines an activity performed on or with a patient as part of the provision of care. It corresponds with surgeries and procedures performed, including endoscopies and biopsies, as well as less invasive actions like counseling and physiotherapy.</p><p>The Procedure (Surgeries) API is designed to summarize any performed surgical procedures for a patient. Other types of procedures may be returned in other APIs, such as the Procedure (Orders) API for procedures created from orders.</p><p>Organizations can have differences when determining which performable activities are classified as procedures, so the types of activities included in FHIR Procedure search can vary between organizations.</p><p>Because terminology codes for procedures are often billing related, some procedures might not have a standard code (for example, CPT), especially when billing activities are not performed within Epic.  For organizations that do perform billing activities within Epic, procedures might not have a CPT code until the charges are generated for the procedure.</p><p>This resource is designed for a high-level summarization around the occurrence of a procedure, and not for specific procedure log documentation - a concept that does not yet have a defined FHIR Resource.
